Hello, my name is Ian. I have 5 years experience working in the field of technology.
I am currently an IT Knowledge Management Specialist with The Anschutz Corporation in Denver.
I am additionally a current Computer Science student at CU Boulder. In my spare time I enjoy
tinkering in my homelab, gardening, snowboarding, hiking and backpacking with my Wife, and of
course reading.

I have always been passionate about technology and hope that you enjoy my website while you're 
here.
