Hello, my name is Ian. I have 5 years experience working in the field of technology.
I am currently an IT Knowledge Management Specialist with The Anschutz Corporation in Denver.
I am additionally a current Computer Science student at CU Boulder. I am passionate about 
the fields of IT and Computer Science, my interests lie in Dev Ops work and Cybersecurity.
This has been heavily inspired by my time tinkering in my Homelab where I run Proxmox,
many Linux VMs, Docker, and Kubernetes. This has afforded me the opportunity to learn a great deal.
