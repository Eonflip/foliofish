# A tale of data
We live in a world of data, data runs your phone, your television, your car, and very likely your schedule as well. Well where does this data all live in the digital world? Great question, where does YOUR data live? I think that something we've lost track of in this overwhelming digital world is where does your important data live. Many of my most valuable photos live on my iPhone + iCloud (Apple Servers) what would happen if Apple's servers went down or they decided they just didn't like me anymore? Well hopefully all my precious photos would then live on my phone, but let's be honest some of us have photo libraries that have outgrown their phones minimal storage.

This isn't true for everyonee of course, but the point I'm trying to convey is that where your data lives needs to be understood for you to develop any sort of control over it.

That's my intro to 3-2-1, now let's talk about what 3-2-1 means.

## What is 3-2-1?
3-2-1 is a phrase that you'll probably hear if you have any co-workers or loved ones who work in technology or are tech hobbiests themselves. 

3-2-1 stands for a backup that lives in 3 different places on at least 2 different devices with at least 1 of those devices offsite. 

What does this mean? Let's break it down.
